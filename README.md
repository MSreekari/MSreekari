## Hi there! 👋

I’m a CS student building full-stack applications with React and Spring Boot.

I enjoy working on real-world projects involving authentication, RBAC, dashboards, and backend architecture, while improving my Java, OOP, and DSA skills.

Currently focused on learning clean system design and writing maintainable, production-ready code.
